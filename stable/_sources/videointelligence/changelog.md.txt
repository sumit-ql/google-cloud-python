### Features

#### General Availability

The `google-cloud-videointelligence` package is now supported at the
**general availability** quality level. This means it is stable; the code
and API surface will not change in backwards-incompatible ways unless
absolutely necessary (e.g. because of critical security issues) or with an
extensive deprecation period.

One exception to this: We will remove beta endpoints (as a semver-minor update)
at whatever point the underlying endpoints go away.

#### v1 endpoint

The underlying video intelligence API has also gone general availability, and
this library by default now uses the `v1` endpoint (rather than `v1beta2`)
unless you explicitly used something else. This is a backwards compatible
change as the `v1` and `v1beta2` endpoints are identical. If you pinned to
`v1beta2`, you are encouraged to move to `v1`.
