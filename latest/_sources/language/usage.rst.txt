Natural Language
================

The `Google Natural Language`_ API can be used to reveal the
structure and meaning of text via powerful machine
learning models. You can use it to extract information about
people, places, events and much more, mentioned in text documents,
news articles or blog posts. You can use it to understand
sentiment about your product on social media or parse intent from
customer conversations happening in a call center or a messaging
app. You can analyze text uploaded in your request or integrate
with your document storage on Google Cloud Storage.

********************************
Authentication and Configuration
********************************

- For an overview of authentication in ``google-cloud-python``,
  see :doc:`/core/auth`.

- In addition to any authentication configuration, you should also set the
  :envvar:`GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT` environment variable for the project you'd
  like to interact with. If the :envvar:`GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT` environment
  variable is not present, the project ID from JSON file credentials is used.

  If you are using Google App Engine or Google Compute Engine
  this will be detected automatically.

- After configuring your environment, create a
  :class:`~google.cloud.language_v1.LanguageServiceClient`.

.. code-block:: python

     >>> from google.cloud import language
     >>> client = language.LanguageServiceClient()

or pass in ``credentials`` explicitly.

.. code-block:: python

     >>> from google.cloud import language
     >>> client = language.LanguageServiceClient(
     ...     credentials=creds,
     ... )


*********
Documents
*********

The Google Natural Language API has three supported methods

- `analyzeEntities`_
- `analyzeSentiment`_
- `analyzeEntitySentiment`_
- `annotateText`_

and each method uses a :class:`~.language_v1.types.Document` for representing
text.

  .. code-block:: python

      >>> document = language.types.Document(
      ...     content='Google, headquartered in Mountain View, unveiled the '
      ...             'new Android phone at the Consumer Electronic Show.  '
      ...             'Sundar Pichai said in his keynote that users love '
      ...             'their new Android phones.',
      ...     language='en',
      ...     type='PLAIN_TEXT',
      ... )


The document's language defaults to ``None``, which will cause the API to
auto-detect the language.

In addition, you can construct an HTML document:

  .. code-block:: python

      >>> html_content = """\
      ... <html>
      ...   <head>
      ...     <title>El Tiempo de las Historias</time>
      ...   </head>
      ...   <body>
      ...     <p>La vaca salt&oacute; sobre la luna.</p>
      ...   </body>
      ... </html>
      ... """
      >>> document = language.types.Document(
      ...     content=html_content,
      ...     language='es',
      ...     type='HTML',
      ... )

The ``language`` argument can be either ISO-639-1 or BCP-47 language
codes. The API reference page contains the full list of `supported languages`_.

.. _supported languages: https://cloud.google.com/natural-language/docs/languages


In addition to supplying the text / HTML content, a document can refer
to content stored in `Google Cloud Storage`_.

  .. code-block:: python

     >>> document = language.types.Document(
     ...     gcs_content_uri='gs://my-text-bucket/sentiment-me.txt',
     ...     type=language.enums.HTML,
     ... )

.. _analyzeEntities: https://cloud.google.com/natural-language/docs/reference/rest/v1/documents/analyzeEntities
.. _analyzeSentiment: https://cloud.google.com/natural-language/docs/reference/rest/v1/documents/analyzeSentiment
.. _analyzeEntitySentiment: https://cloud.google.com/natural-language/docs/reference/rest/v1/documents/analyzeEntitySentiment
.. _annotateText: https://cloud.google.com/natural-language/docs/reference/rest/v1/documents/annotateText
.. _Google Cloud Storage: https://cloud.google.com/storage/

****************
Analyze Entities
****************

The :meth:`~.language_v1.LanguageServiceClient.analyze_entities`
method finds named entities (i.e. proper names) in the text. This method
returns a :class:`~.language_v1.types.AnalyzeEntitiesResponse`.

  .. code-block:: python

     >>> document = language.types.Document(
     ...     content='Michelangelo Caravaggio, Italian painter, is '
     ...             'known for "The Calling of Saint Matthew".',
     ...     type=language.enums.Document.Type.PLAIN_TEXT,
     ... )
     >>> response = client.analyze_entities(
     ...     document=document,
     ...     encoding_type='UTF32',
     ... )
     >>> for entity in response.entities:
     ...     print('=' * 20)
     ...     print('         name: {0}'.format(entity.name))
     ...     print('         type: {0}'.format(entity.entity_type))
     ...     print('     metadata: {0}'.format(entity.metadata))
     ...     print('     salience: {0}'.format(entity.salience))
     ====================
              name: Michelangelo Caravaggio
              type: PERSON
          metadata: {'wikipedia_url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caravaggio'}
          salience: 0.7615959
     ====================
              name: Italian
              type: LOCATION
          metadata: {'wikipedia_url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy'}
          salience: 0.19960518
     ====================
              name: The Calling of Saint Matthew
              type: EVENT
          metadata: {'wikipedia_url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Calling_of_St_Matthew_(Caravaggio)'}
          salience: 0.038798928

.. note::

  It is recommended to send an ``encoding_type`` argument to Natural
  Language methods, so they provide useful offsets for the data they return.
  While the correct value varies by environment, in Python you *usually*
  want ``UTF32``.


*****************
Analyze Sentiment
*****************

The :meth:`~.language_v1.LanguageServiceClient.analyze_sentiment` method
analyzes the sentiment of the provided text. This method returns a
:class:`~.language_v1.types.AnalyzeSentimentResponse`.

  .. code-block:: python

     >>> document = language.types.Document(
     ...     content='Jogging is not very fun.',
     ...     type='PLAIN_TEXT',
     ... )
     >>> response = client.analyze_sentiment(
     ...     document=document,
     ...     encoding_type='UTF32',
     ... )
     >>> sentiment = response.document_sentiment
     >>> print(sentiment.score)
     -1
     >>> print(sentiment.magnitude)
     0.8

.. note::

************************
Analyze Entity Sentiment
************************

The :meth:`~.language_v1.LanguageServiceClient.analyze_entity_sentiment`
method is effectively the amalgamation of
:meth:`~.language_v1.LanguageServiceClient.analyze_entities` and
:meth:`~.language_v1.LanguageServiceClient.analyze_sentiment`.
This method returns a
:class:`~.language_v1.types.AnalyzeEntitySentimentResponse`.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> document = language.types.Document(
    ...     content='Mona said that jogging is very fun.',
    ...     type='PLAIN_TEXT',
    ... )
    >>> response = client.analyze_sentiment(
    ...     document=document,
    ...     encoding_type='UTF32',
    ... )
    >>> entities = response.entities
    >>> entities[0].name
    'Mona'
    >>> entities[1].name
    'jogging'
    >>> entities[1].sentiment.magnitude
    0.8
    >>> entities[1].sentiment.score
    0.8

*************
Annotate Text
*************

The :meth:`~.language_v1.LanguageServiceClient.annotate_text` method
analyzes a document and is intended for users who are familiar with
machine learning and need in-depth text features to build upon. This method
returns a :class:`~.language_v1.types.AnnotateTextResponse`.


*************
API Reference
*************

This package includes clients for multiple versions of the Natural Language
API. By default, you will get ``v1``, the latest GA version.

.. toctree::
  :maxdepth: 2

  gapic/v1/api
  gapic/v1/types

If you are interested in beta features ahead of the latest GA, you may
opt-in to the v1.1 beta, which is spelled ``v1beta2``. In order to do this,
you will want to import from ``google.cloud.language_v1beta2`` in lieu of
``google.cloud.language``.

An API and type reference is provided for the v1.1 beta also:

.. toctree::
  :maxdepth: 2

  gapic/v1beta2/api
  gapic/v1beta2/types

.. note::

  The client for the beta API is provided on a provisional basis. The API
  surface is subject to change, and it is possible that this client will be
  deprecated or removed after its features become GA.
