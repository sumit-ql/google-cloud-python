<span id="spanner-txn"></span><h1>Transactions<a class="headerlink" href="#transactions" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h1>
<p>Each session can have at most one active transaction at a time. After
the active transaction is completed, the session can immediately be
re-used for the next transaction. It is not necessary to create a new
session for each transaction.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="transaction-modes">
<h1>Transaction Modes<a class="headerlink" href="#transaction-modes" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h1>
<p>Cloud Spanner supports two transaction modes:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Locking read-write. This type of transaction is the only way to write
data into Cloud Spanner. These transactions rely on pessimistic
locking and, if necessary, two-phase commit. Locking read-write
transactions may abort, requiring the application to retry.</li>
<li>Snapshot read-only. This transaction type provides guaranteed
consistency across several reads, but does not allow writes. Snapshot
read-only transactions can be configured to read at timestamps in the
past. Snapshot read-only transactions do not need to be committed.</li>
</ol>
<p>For transactions that only read, snapshot read-only transactions provide
simpler semantics and are almost always faster. In particular, read-only
transactions do not take locks, so they do not conflict with read-write
transactions. As a consequence of not taking locks, they also do not
abort, so retry loops are not needed.</p>
<p>Transactions may only read/write data in a single database. They may,
however, read/write data in different tables within that database.</p>
<div class="section" id="locking-read-write-transactions">
<h2>Locking Read-Write Transactions<a class="headerlink" href="#locking-read-write-transactions" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<p>Locking transactions may be used to atomically read-modify-write data
anywhere in a database. This type of transaction is externally
consistent.</p>
<p>Clients should attempt to minimize the amount of time a transaction is
active. Faster transactions commit with higher probability and cause
less contention. Cloud Spanner attempts to keep read locks active as
long as the transaction continues to do reads, and the transaction has
not been terminated by [Commit][google.spanner.v1.Spanner.Commit] or
[Rollback][google.spanner.v1.Spanner.Rollback]. Long periods of
inactivity at the client may cause Cloud Spanner to release a
transaction’s locks and abort it.</p>
<p>Reads performed within a transaction acquire locks on the data being
read. Writes can only be done at commit time, after all reads have been
completed. Conceptually, a read-write transaction consists of zero or
more reads or SQL queries followed by
[Commit][google.spanner.v1.Spanner.Commit]. At any time before
[Commit][google.spanner.v1.Spanner.Commit], the client can send a
[Rollback][google.spanner.v1.Spanner.Rollback] request to abort the
transaction.</p>
<div class="section" id="semantics">
<h3>Semantics<a class="headerlink" href="#semantics" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h3>
<p>Cloud Spanner can commit the transaction if all read locks it acquired
are still valid at commit time, and it is able to acquire write locks
for all writes. Cloud Spanner can abort the transaction for any reason.
If a commit attempt returns <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ABORTED</span></code>, Cloud Spanner guarantees that
the transaction has not modified any user data in Cloud Spanner.</p>
<p>Unless the transaction commits, Cloud Spanner makes no guarantees about
how long the transaction’s locks were held for. It is an error to use
Cloud Spanner locks for any sort of mutual exclusion other than between
Cloud Spanner transactions themselves.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="retrying-aborted-transactions">
<h3>Retrying Aborted Transactions<a class="headerlink" href="#retrying-aborted-transactions" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h3>
<p>When a transaction aborts, the application can choose to retry the whole
transaction again. To maximize the chances of successfully committing
the retry, the client should execute the retry in the same session as
the original attempt. The original session’s lock priority increases
with each consecutive abort, meaning that each attempt has a slightly
better chance of success than the previous.</p>
<p>Under some circumstances (e.g., many transactions attempting to modify
the same row(s)), a transaction can abort many times in a short period
before successfully committing. Thus, it is not a good idea to cap the
number of retries a transaction can attempt; instead, it is better to
limit the total amount of wall time spent retrying.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="idle-transactions">
<h3>Idle Transactions<a class="headerlink" href="#idle-transactions" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h3>
<p>A transaction is considered idle if it has no outstanding reads or SQL
queries and has not started a read or SQL query within the last 10
seconds. Idle transactions can be aborted by Cloud Spanner so that they
don’t hold on to locks indefinitely. In that case, the commit will fail
with error <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ABORTED</span></code>.</p>
<p>If this behavior is undesirable, periodically executing a simple SQL
query in the transaction (e.g., <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">SELECT</span> <span class="pre">1</span></code>) prevents the transaction
from becoming idle.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="snapshot-read-only-transactions">
<h2>Snapshot Read-Only Transactions<a class="headerlink" href="#snapshot-read-only-transactions" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<p>Snapshot read-only transactions provides a simpler method than locking
read-write transactions for doing several consistent reads. However,
this type of transaction does not support writes.</p>
<p>Snapshot transactions do not take locks. Instead, they work by choosing
a Cloud Spanner timestamp, then executing all reads at that timestamp.
Since they do not acquire locks, they do not block concurrent read-write
transactions.</p>
<p>Unlike locking read-write transactions, snapshot read-only transactions
never abort. They can fail if the chosen read timestamp is garbage
collected; however, the default garbage collection policy is generous
enough that most applications do not need to worry about this in
practice.</p>
<p>Snapshot read-only transactions do not need to call
[Commit][google.spanner.v1.Spanner.Commit] or
[Rollback][google.spanner.v1.Spanner.Rollback] (and in fact are not
permitted to do so).</p>
<p>To execute a snapshot transaction, the client specifies a timestamp
bound, which tells Cloud Spanner how to choose a read timestamp.</p>
<p>The types of timestamp bound are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Strong (the default).</li>
<li>Bounded staleness.</li>
<li>Exact staleness.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the Cloud Spanner database to be read is geographically distributed,
stale read-only transactions can execute more quickly than strong or
read-write transaction, because they are able to execute far from the
leader replica.</p>
<p>Each type of timestamp bound is discussed in detail below.</p>
<div class="section" id="strong">
<h3>Strong<a class="headerlink" href="#strong" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h3>
<p>Strong reads are guaranteed to see the effects of all transactions that
have committed before the start of the read. Furthermore, all rows
yielded by a single read are consistent with each other – if any part
of the read observes a transaction, all parts of the read see the
transaction.</p>
<p>Strong reads are not repeatable: two consecutive strong read-only
transactions might return inconsistent results if there are concurrent
writes. If consistency across reads is required, the reads should be
executed within a transaction or at an exact read timestamp.</p>
<p>See
[TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.strong][google.spanner.v1.TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.strong].</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="exact-staleness">
<h3>Exact Staleness<a class="headerlink" href="#exact-staleness" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h3>
<p>These timestamp bounds execute reads at a user-specified timestamp.
Reads at a timestamp are guaranteed to see a consistent prefix of the
global transaction history: they observe modifications done by all
transactions with a commit timestamp &lt;= the read timestamp, and observe
none of the modifications done by transactions with a larger commit
timestamp. They will block until all conflicting transactions that may
be assigned commit timestamps &lt;= the read timestamp have finished.</p>
<p>The timestamp can either be expressed as an absolute Cloud Spanner
commit timestamp or a staleness relative to the current time.</p>
<p>These modes do not require a “negotiation phase” to pick a timestamp. As
a result, they execute slightly faster than the equivalent boundedly
stale concurrency modes. On the other hand, boundedly stale reads
usually return fresher results.</p>
<p>See
[TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.read_timestamp][google.spanner.v1.TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.read_timestamp]
and
[TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.exact_staleness][google.spanner.v1.TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.exact_staleness].</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="bounded-staleness">
<h3>Bounded Staleness<a class="headerlink" href="#bounded-staleness" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h3>
<p>Bounded staleness modes allow Cloud Spanner to pick the read timestamp,
subject to a user-provided staleness bound. Cloud Spanner chooses the
newest timestamp within the staleness bound that allows execution of the
reads at the closest available replica without blocking.</p>
<p>All rows yielded are consistent with each other – if any part of the
read observes a transaction, all parts of the read see the transaction.
Boundedly stale reads are not repeatable: two stale reads, even if they
use the same staleness bound, can execute at different timestamps and
thus return inconsistent results.</p>
<p>Boundedly stale reads execute in two phases: the first phase negotiates
a timestamp among all replicas needed to serve the read. In the second
phase, reads are executed at the negotiated timestamp.</p>
<p>As a result of the two phase execution, bounded staleness reads are
usually a little slower than comparable exact staleness reads. However,
they are typically able to return fresher results, and are more likely
to execute at the closest replica.</p>
<p>Because the timestamp negotiation requires up-front knowledge of which
rows will be read, it can only be used with single-use read-only
transactions.</p>
<p>See
[TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.max_staleness][google.spanner.v1.TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.max_staleness]
and
[TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.min_read_timestamp][google.spanner.v1.TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.min_read_timestamp].</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="old-read-timestamps-and-garbage-collection">
<h3>Old Read Timestamps and Garbage Collection<a class="headerlink" href="#old-read-timestamps-and-garbage-collection" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h3>
<p>Cloud Spanner continuously garbage collects deleted and overwritten data
in the background to reclaim storage space. This process is known as
“version GC”. By default, version GC reclaims versions after they are
one hour old. Because of this, Cloud Spanner cannot perform reads at
read timestamps more than one hour in the past. This restriction also
applies to in-progress reads and/or SQL queries whose timestamp become
too old while executing. Reads and SQL queries with too-old read
timestamps fail with the error <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">FAILED_PRECONDITION</span></code>.</p>
